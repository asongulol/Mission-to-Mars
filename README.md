# Mission-to-Mars
WE created a simple website using python web scraping beautiful soup and splinter. Flask was used as a simple microframework for the website.

The app.py can be found in \challenge directory and the templates in \challenge\templates.

Two html files were used:

1. index.html - is the main scraping and information page with a link to...
2. hemispheres.html - this contains a full HD image in a carousal format of the moons of Mars.

Here is the view of the home page:
